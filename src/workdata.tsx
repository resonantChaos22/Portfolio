      "I created this personal website using React (NextJS) and styled it with TailwindCSS to display my work and give recruiters more information about me. The design is simple yet visually appealing, with two sections for an introduction and showcasing my projects and skills. I plan to expand it with a 'non-professional' section, an education section, and a list of relevant courses in the future.",

      "As a member of a 4-person team tasked with creating a website, I took charge of developing the backend from scratch using Node.js and incorporating Docker for streamlined collaboration. My role also included implementing robust CRUD APIs for multiple models, as well as integrating email and Google authentication for enhanced security. Furthermore, I successfully implemented Amazon S3-based upload functionality both in the frontend and backend. Through this experience, I was able to deepen my knowledge of industry standards and naming conventions, while honing my skills as a backend developer.",
